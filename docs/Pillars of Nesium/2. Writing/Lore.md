## TIMELINE

### THE BEGINNING

This story begins somewhere in the time of the Ancients, as nobody knows what came before them. We won’t go into detail, as the aims of the Ancients are as inscrutable as their mere existence. To the men of the modern era they are formless, incomprehensible things, who confuse the senses of all they encounter and who see the world in a different way. We only need to know that despite their immense intelligence and technological feats, their kind disappeared from the world many millennia ago.

  

### THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION

1.  Following the discovery of an entity that threatened to end mankind, the Ancients underwent a transformation. They turned themselves into immortal spirits and bound themselves to their own machinery, so that they could ensure it would last indefinitely. The machines built by the Ancients would become a fact of the world much like the wind and the tide.  
      
    Up until then, man was still ruled by the inscrutable ancients, though now they numbered far fewer. In time they lost their grasp of the primitive peoples, and fell in time to their uprisings. This left primitive man in a curious position. A race of caged rats set loose upon the strange world the ancients had abandoned.
    
2.  Following the realisation that the continued existence of the ancients harmed the balance of the planet more than it helped , most of the ancients were eradicated by their own hand. However, not every ancient agreed with this decision. War ensued, 
    

### THE AGE OF CHAOS

What ensued was the Age of Chaos. Technology was unearthed in swathes by man. A series of small conflicts ensued where the lucky obliterated the unlucky, by virtue of having stumbled upon the better technology. Powerful weaponry that could eradicate legions of men in seconds tore through the land, leaving it battered and scarred. Soon only a few enclaves of men remained: Those that had banded together to bring some order to the chaos sewn by their newfound freedom. Man had managed to stop themselves short of total destruction.

### THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT

The remaining enclaves settled on a shaky peace and set to work trying to understand the newfound  technology: where it had come from, who had made it, and what had become of them. Deterred by the rampant destruction and suffering of the Age of Chaos, this peaceful age lasted for many generations. But with time, men forgot the lessons of the past, setting aside that useless information and instead learning the inner workings of this incredible technology. Once again, ambition overtook fear. Old King Harlo was the first to strike, eradicating several of the smaller Kingdoms in one fell swoop, and beginning a new age of destruction.

### THE FIRST GREAT WAR

Opposite Old King Harlo, far beyond the deserts of Nesium(1), was King Nostallos. Anticipating King Harlo’s betrayal, Nostallos fortified the region of Nesium. It was known to Nostallos through his network of spies that King Harlo was a threat, and for the longest time Nostallos had been attempting to uncover the secrets of the great Pillars in Nesium. He decided to double down, knowing full well that Harlo had an equal interest in those pillars and would be reluctant to destroy them.

His gamble paid off in the end, as the Pillars had been storing immense quantities of energy by siphoning the region’s extensive weather activity.

The battle of Nesium ended in a resounding victory for King Nostallos, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of the continent, which he named after himself. No one could challenge him.

### THE AGE OF DECADENCE

The age of peace following can be attributed largely to the efforts of Emperor Nostallos, who ruled the continent with an iron fist until the time of his death. 

### THE SECOND GREAT WAR

That time was when everything began to fall apart. Generations passed and the Nostallos legacy was forgotten. The kingdoms once again fell to bickering, blinded by their greed. The loyal vassals of old were replaced by corrupt and greedy patricians. The spread of ancient tech mandated by the rule of Emperor Nostallos meant each nation was armed to the teeth in equal measures, and none could find common ground.

The ensuing war caused only destruction, bringing each kingdom to its knees as famines, plagues, and the death of billions ushered the world into a new dark age. Centuries passed, history living on only through ruins and word of mouth. Ancient tech gained a notoriety for being cursed, dooming any who use it to great misfortune. This was not far from the truth.

### THE DARK AGE

Corrupted by magic, scarred by war, with man reduced to mere millions worldwide, the world takes on a new shape. Emboldened by the now barren world, the beasts and other races that had once been dominated by man now exert their will upon the realm. The gnomes, the owlfolk, the froglings, the undead, the goblins, the trolls, and so on. The land is pockmarked by lush forests, great mountain ranges, enormous craters, barren deserts, underground labyrinths, radiated zones, toxic jungles, and so on. Some of the old tech exists, but much of it was used or destroyed, and many of the ancient ruins are too dangerous to explore.

### THE NEW AGE

Crawling out of their holes, mankind has had to innovate in new ways to survive through the dark age. Some kingdoms have risen again, but still battle fiercely to survive amidst the new and fearsome world.

  

## GENERAL LORE

### NESIUM

Known: Nesium is a great desert dotted with enormous black stone pillars. It’s inhabitants consist of nomad tribes, various desert critters, and a skeletal legion. The nomads and skeletons frequently come to blows, though with each nomad death the skeleton legion grows, and the skeletons merely rise again once struck down.

Unknown: Long ago, Nesium was a thriving forested land. The Ancients built their pillars upon the land, which drew power from the weather. This deprived Nesium of much needed water, exposing it to vast amounts of sun, eventually turning the land to barren desert.

### THE PEOPLE OF NESIUM

Known:

Unknown: 

### THE UNDEAD

Known: The undead are a scourge upon Nesium ruled by the Lich that inhabits one of the Pillars.

Unknown: 

### AMNIA

Known: 

Unknown: 

### THE MONUMENTS/PILLARS

Known

The pillars rise high into the clouds, though strangely there only ever seem to be clouds around the pillars. Some of the pillars have toppled completely into the sands below, but most still stand tall. They are pre-dark age structures, and nobody knows their true purposes. Surrounding some pillars are desert oases, though most are dry and barren as the desert that surrounds them. Waterfalls run down the sheer black walls and nourish the lands below, giving life to the people of Nesium and its critters.

Unknown

These great Pillars are conduits that draw power from the weather and fuel the ancient machines below the sands. Solvat is a waste product of these machines, a combustible substance that rises to the surface and causes strange magical phenomena. It is also a potent explosive. Some of the pillars still function to this day, and it is for this reason that the land of Nesium remains mostly a barren desert. Perhaps one day the people will discover the purpose of these pillars, and restore nesium to its former verdant glory.  
  
Beneath the pillars lies an enormous industrial complex of ancient machines that still run despite thousands of years having passed.

### THE ANCIENTS

Known: Virtually nothing is known about the Ancients except that they were a highly advanced civilisation that predates the Dark Age, and so there is no written history of them. They left no visual depictions of themselves or records of their history or culture when they departed, only their advanced technology and ancient structures.

Unknown

1.  The Ancients were once human. They hailed from an isolated region of Nostallos, and were some of the first humans to discover magic. They used their discoveries to advance technology, explore the world, and learn its secrets. The Ancients inserted themselves into various cultures as powerful rulers, the primitive people astonished by their magical abilities, seeing them as gods.  
      
    An Ancient researcher by the name of Galanos unearthed a great secret. He discovered the existence of a being that lay dormant within the earth, a being known as Ur. When it wakes, its mere movements would rip the continent apart, and ravage the rest of the world with earthquakes and tsunamis.

### THE LICH

Known: The Lich is an ever growing scourge upon Nesium. Spreading from the Pillar of Elshis, it slowly takes more and more of the land, slaughtering the primitive tribes, and adding their ranks to his own. 

The Lich commands three undead acolytes; loyal servants with great power.

Skeleton with the power of the elements; flesh/machine amalgamation; 

Unknown:

1.  The Lich is a scholar of Ancient history, having lived since Nostallos’ reign. He is aware of the imminent destruction of Nostallos, but welcomes it, and seeks to bring the day closer. Reasoning: Life would surely be better if all men died and rose anew, with no need to fight any wars, no more suffering, no hunger, no sickness, no pain.
    
2.  The Lich is a scholar of Ancient history, having lived since Nostallos’ reign. He knows that Nostallos once used the pillar to develop machines of war, and wishes to use that same power once again. He is on the cusp of figuring it out.
