# The Storm

Caught in a sandstorm, you are separated from your hunting party, and must traverse the desert alone to reach the pillar. When you reach it, you find the remains of the hunting party strewn about the desert sand. In the midst of the carnage stands a lone skeleton, clad in a black cloak. The skeleton gives you the choice to fight or flee. If you flee, youâ€™re shot in the back of the head.
