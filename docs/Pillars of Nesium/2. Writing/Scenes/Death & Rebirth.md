# Outline
This scene is optional. But basically the demo can begin with an animation of the Nomad's skeleton removing it self

# Description
After being wounded by Solomon, the Nomad undergoes a horrific transformation as his skeleton wrenches itself from his body. This process is fatal.
His skeleton becomes a mindless lackey and joins the ranks.
His flesh is sent into a pit to be processed by another one of the Lich's underlings. Nothing is wasted. The Nomad's corpse hurtles down into the depths before landing in a pile of alike remains.

The Nomad undergoes another transformation. His body is restored and reanimated by a mysterious magical force. A dialogue ensues revealing that he has been revived by a powerful guardian spirit because of the bravery he displayed by challenging Solomon.

At the same time, the Guardian Spirit blesses the character's sword with wind magic.
