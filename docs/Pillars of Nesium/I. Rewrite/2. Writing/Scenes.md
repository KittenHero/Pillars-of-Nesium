# Scenes
### What is a Scene?
Scenes are story events that occur throughout the game. Often scenes allow the player a number of choices in how they deal with the situation, though often only one of these choices is correct, but not always.

### How is a Scene different from a Cut-scene?
During a cut-scene, the game 'cuts' away from game play to show a cinematic in which the player has little to no control.

During a Scene, there are significant narrative or story events occurring but the player still retains control of his character. He decides how to react, expressing his decision through the game mechanics or through dialogue choices, instead of being a mere observer.

I have written some example scenes below, though some are unfinished.
