## In-Game UI

### Indicators

Will be represented visually where possible. Health represented by a glow around the player, but also a number of icons representing 1 Guardian Spirit HP each.

### Camera

Fixed or free? Toggle between? Blaster is short range. Probably just have a look-mode with fixed default. Will have to plat some other games, see how they handle it.
