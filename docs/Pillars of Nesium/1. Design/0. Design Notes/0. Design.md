## Mechanics Summary

## Story Summary
You play as a primitive desert nomad, seeking to ascend one of the many black pillars that populate the otherwise barren desert. The pillars are ancient and dangerous machines filled with devious traps, deadly automatons and the lifeless corpses of past adventurers. The game is a a platformer with a focus on combat & exploration built around a normal dude with wind magic.

## Interface:
Mouse & keyboard. Minimal UI. HP, ammo, etc. represented visually or UI as close to where the player should be looking as possible. E.g. weapon charge on aiming reticle, glow around player to represent guardian spirit's protection, and so on.

## Art Style:
Generally washed out and drab except for key areas, e.g. checkpoints, to make them feel more inviting, or on enemies, to make them stand out and seem more threatening. In other words threats, checkpoints, items, anything that the player would want to obtain or avoid should stand out from the environment, either with colour or animation.

## Music/Sound:
Mixture of acoustic & synth sounds with a middle eastern folk music style. SFX will use recorded acoustic sounds mixed with synthesised SFX where appropriate
