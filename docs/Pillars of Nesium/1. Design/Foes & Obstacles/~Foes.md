# Foes

## Organisation

Enemies are arranged by Zone. There is a generic list for unassigned enemies, or enemies that can appear anywhere.

Below is a list of relevant statistics.

### Naming Conventions
Come up with a vaguely arabic/egyptian name for each enemy and boss, in addition to their ‘thematic’ name.

### Enemy
The name of the enemy.

### Zone
The Zones the enemy can be found.

### HP
The creature dies when HP reaches 0 or less. Listed values are not final, but gives an indication of relevant strengths. Keep in mind the player starts with 2 HP, and 90% of enemy attacks deal 1 Damage. Even then, the Guardian Spirit system ensures the player dies in no less than 2 hits.

### Features
Creatures may have a number of features that describe general characteristics. Here is a list:
- Ground: Enemy is ground based.
- Flying: Enemy can move freely through space.
- Climber: Enemy can move on walls.
- Ambush: Enemy waits in hiding until the player triggers it. All other enemies are plain to see, and probably walk around the level on a fixed path.
- Mini-Boss: Encountered very infrequently and don't respawn. Highly challenging, often with great rewards.


## Generic

| Enemy | Zone | HP | Features | Description | Attacks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skeleton | Any | 3 | Ground | A skeleton wielding a scimitar. The scimitar is a traditional weapon of the protagonist's home village. | Windmill: Waves his sword in an upward circular motion attacking in front and above him.
Lunge: Jumps forward, sword raised above head, then slams it down on the ground. |
| Scaveneer | Anywhere in Pillar | 2 | Climber | Small metallic spider-like beings that scurry around and gather spare and broken parts. They constantly build new parts and scrap the old. Sometimes they scuffle over choice parts. Pretty harmless unless there's a Scholar around. | Swarm: If a Scholar is present, all Scaveneers in the area will make a beeline for the player. If a scaveneer walks over Monster Parts, it will pick it up. |
| Servant | Anywhere in Pillar | 10 | Armoured, Flying, Mini-Boss | Flying sphere of liquid metal. Makes oppressive humming sound. | Spike: Launches a long range spike at the player by changing its shape. Must be jumped over, or slid under at the last second. Only armour-piercing blaster shot will remove its exterior. All other attacks will make useless clinking noises. |
| Scholar | Anywhere in Pillar | 1 |  | Ancient undead beings with metal and stone grafted into their flesh. They wander the ancient ruins, overseeing their machinations, ever adding improvements to the vast structures, to no apparent end. | Very easy to kill but will summon scaveneers to attack the player until it is killed. |
| Eye of Abydos 0 | Anywhere | 1 | Flying | A curious floating eye that appears from nowhere and stares at the player. | Summon more enemies?  |
| Eye of Abydos 1 | Archives | 4 | Floating, stationary, large | Fires slow homing bolts of shadow. Intent is to make platforming more difficult until it can be reached and killed. |  |
| Eye of Abydos 2 | Archives | 3 | Float, Teleport | Teleports around and fires beams that linger briefly. Difficult harassment enemy |  |
| Eyes of Abydos |  |  |  |  |  |

## Desert Bosses

| Name | Zone | Phases | HP | Behaviour | Description |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solomon |  |  |  | Solomon attacks with guns, fire, and smoke.
Will cover the screen with waves of flame - must be dodged with the blaster.
Fires a ricocheting shot.

Will fire shots in quick succession telegraphed with an aim, which must be deflected with precise timing.
Will then disappear into a haze of smoke to reload whilst shadowy minions harass the player - a keen-eyed player can locate and attack solomon based on the sound of the reloading shells, whilst avoiding attacks from minions. | A humble skeleton wearing a tattered brown cloak. This cloak disguises Solomon, making him appear as a human with flesh intact. Solomon’s true form sees him wearing a black cloak and hat that partially conceal his skeletal visage. He wields large revolvers. |  |
| Nadab | Deluge & Flesh Pits |  |  |  | Nechepso is as tall as three men, with a brilliant blue cloak draped over his skeletal figure. |  |
| Watcher Abydos | Archives |  |  |  | Like Nechepso, Abydos’ true form is over 10 feet tall, only he wears a dark cloak that obscures his visage, which is a twisted mask of eyes with divided pupils. |  |
| Avaris | Gardens |  |  |  | ___  |  |
| Blood Demon | Flesh Pits |  |  |  | Defeating the blood demon leads into the flesh pits final stage. The area slowly fills with blood, forcing the player to climb out of the area as quickly as he can, lest he drowns in the blood. This is considered one of the boss phase. |  |
| Machination | Flesh Pits |  |  | 
 |  |  |
| Ancient Guardians | Upper Pillar |  |  |  | Tall bronze statues of blind-folded females.  |  |
| Corrupted Servant | Outer Pillar |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  | A lumbering amalgamation of discarded construct parts. Arms, legs, heads and even genitalia protrude crudely from this monstrosity. Its power source is partially exposed, beaming a sickening light from within the being’s core. Usually encountered alongside several Scaveneers. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Lich King Solomon

## Nechepso

Nechepso commands powers of ice, time, and death, allowing him to raise the dead even while they are still living. Nechepso can stop time locally, and radiates deathly cold. He represents the inevitable march toward a cold end. He seeks to find Infinity, something that doesn't end, for he knows that even his own time is limited.

## Watcher Abydos

Watcher Abydos, the all seeing eye, everywhere and nowhere. As a collection of souls, he can send fractions of his consciousness far away from his body to view the happenings of the world, and commands many clever spies.

He can shapeshift and divide his form too, but is at his strongest when whole. He takes control of gravity and moves about through portals placed in convenient locations.

Watcher Abydos seeks to have control over every facet of his life, to have insight into every action, every word and every thought. To become OMNIPOTENT. However, he is constantly fighting to reign in the thousands of souls trapped inside him. 

## The Ancient Guardians

The Ancient Guardians protect the ruins of the Ancients, curiously made in the image of human females despite being Ancient technology. They fight as if in a dance, bounding across the terrain, making broad sweeps and long lunges. Always in pairs.

### Attacks

Command: The ancient guardian can bellow orders (e.g. move left, jump, roll) represented by an aura blasted outwards. If the player is not performing that order before the aura reaches him, he suffers damage.

## Solomon, Seeker of the Eternal Flame

Found in the Deluge

Boss fight: Fast, firey.

Key: Use well timed blaster shots to clear flames, and damage the highly nimble solomon.

Arena: A clear stone room with a thin layer of water on the ground.

Movement: Solomon can launch himself through the air

### Attacks

Fire Ball: Solomon stands at one side of the screen, launches fireballs which must be jumped over or ducked under.

Steam Cloud: Solomon blasts fire at the ground, turning the water into steam and obscuring his attacks. After a few seconds the steam dissipates and returns to being water on the ground. Only the red glow of fire will telegraph his next attacking position.

## Brucius, Seeker of Flesh

Found in the Flesh Pits
