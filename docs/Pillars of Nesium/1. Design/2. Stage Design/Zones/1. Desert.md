# Desert Zone
## Description
The desert zone includes all areas on the surface outside of the pillar. It includes the first stage of the game, and some later stages that involve further treks across the desert.

## Design
### Purpose
**Narrative**: Establishes the desert as a harsh environment, but also one in which a home can be made. Establishes the scenario and the character's motivations - conflicting loyalty, vengeance.
**Gameplay**: Teaches the basic mechanics and sets up the story.

### Visuals
Colour: Dry, washed out, ochre colours. The character doesn't stand out here. Contrast with the deep, cold grey of the pillar.
Aesthetic:
