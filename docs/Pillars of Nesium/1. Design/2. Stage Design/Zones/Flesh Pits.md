### The Flesh Pits
The first real stage. Nechepso turns living men to undead, enchanting their bones such that they tear apart the flesh from the inside. The remaining flesh is tossed into the flesh pits. The restless souls of those that meet the gruesome fate have taken root in the flesh of their bodies, crawling the pits as shambling grotesque monsters. Down here, the player faces the Flesh Demon.

## Descriptive Entry
### Scenes
- Falling Down: The Nomad's flesh remains fall down a series of stone shafts before landing with a sickening wet thump atop the flesh pile. Slowly, the Nomad's body is reformed by the guardian spirit's essence. He doesn't make it far before collapsing. We catch a glimpse of Geildukhuk.
- Awakening: The Nomad awakens in the company of Geildukhuk and a young girl (Fairy). The fairy & guardian spirit play whilst the nomad & geildukhuk have some dialogue. As a parting gift, seeing the nomad's vengeful resolve, geildukhuk hands him the blaster.

### Visuals
Visually there is a distinct visceral horror theme. The levels are strewn with everything from recognisable human corpses to indeterminate reddish-white pulp. There is also an ecosystem of sorts down here - insects, fungus and mould all grow and feast on the death. All on the background of sheer dark grey stone inlaid with ancient carvings.

Colours: red, yellow-white, ochre (primarily gore/viscera mixed with fungus and bacterial growth)

### Stage Design
The Nomad at this point already has the blaster and has a feel for basic movement.
