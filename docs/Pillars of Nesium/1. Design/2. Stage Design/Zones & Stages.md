# Zones & Stages

## The Map
...is the entire area in which the game takes place. For this game, it will be a small portion of the Nesium Desert.

## Zones
A zone is a thematically distinct area within the map. Below is a list of the game's zones, including how they're accessed, and a brief description. Access refers to the specific abilities or items required to access the Zone. Listed below in order of appearance.

### Confirmed Zone List
- **[[1. Desert|Desert]]**
- **[[1. Design/2. Stage Design/Zones/2. Flesh Pits|Flesh Pits]]**
- [[3. Deluge|Deluge]]: A place full of wide expanses, great pools of water, flowing waterfalls, and ambient thunder

### Shortlisted Zones
Not necessarily going to be implemented. Worth considering.
- **The Garden**: Where damage has been done to the deluge, and cracks in the walls have allowed sand to flow in from the storms, life has sprung. Within the gloom of the pillar, rays of light seeping through the walls, vines and trees grow, animals thriving. A curious anomaly.
- **The Archives**
- **The Forge**
- **The Crypt**: Where dead Ancients would be laid to rest. Vacant now, occupied by the Lich
- **The Conduits**: Run laterally down the length of the pillar, adjacent to the Deluge, like the phloem of a great tree
- **The Maze**: This is one of the safeguards that protects the upper section of the pillar. One must know the correct passage, with any error meaning a number of automatons are alerted, which the player must fight before another attempt can be made. The player is met with a number of vertical passages in the background, which he can interact to enter. There are four in each room, and three rooms. Making for 256 combinations. The player needs the Spirit Compass item in order to progress through the maze. Once through the maze, the Ancient Guardians are encountered. One of the last bosses in the game.
- **The Zenith**: The upper sections of the pillar that follow the Ancient Guardian boss fight
- **The Rune Hub**
- **The Outer Wall**: The Outer Wall. The edge of the pillar has been worn away by centuries of storms. High above the surface, the pillar has been worn away enough to expose the inside, featuring grand halls of sheer black stone covered in hills of sand. You must climb from the base of the pillar up the wall until you reach the entrance. 

## Stages
Sub-divisions of a Zone, usually defined as "the area between two checkpoints" are called Stages. Sometimes a checkpoint is a little ways into a stage. A stage can have platforming, combat, or both. Sometimes individual stages require unlockables to be accessed.

### Rooms
Refer to a small, continuous area of gameplay. When travelling between rooms, there is a visual transition as the game opens a new scene. 

### Transitory & Auxillary Stages
Transitory Stages are stages that are not part of the main map that provide a bridge between one area and another. Auxiliary Stages are similar, but act as bonus areas rather than bridges.

### Hubs
A hub refers to a point in the game where the player can rest and receive certain services or meet NPCs. There is never more than one Hub in a zone, and not all Zones have hubs. In some cases, a hub may be the border between a number of Zones. Not all checkpoints are hubs, but all hubs have checkpoints.
