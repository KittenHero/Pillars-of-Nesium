# Zones & Stages

## The Map
...is the entire area in which the game takes place. For this game, it will be a small portion of the Nesium Desert.

## Zones
A zone is a thematically distinct area within the map. Below is a list of the game's zones, including how they're accessed, and a brief description. Access refers to the specific abilities or items required to access the Zone. Listed below in order of appearance.

### The Desert
- Purpose: Teaches the basic mechanics and sets up the story.
- Description: Linear trek through the desert leading up to the pillar. Life becomes more and more scarce as the Nomad heads further to the Pillar. Once the peak of the final dune is reached, life is no more, only skeletons, and the Nomad’s dead tribe members.
- Scenes: Fight with Solomon, the Gun Lich.
 | The Desert | Aplatforming mechanics. No more home village - nomadic tribe.
| Scroad, Vanture, Skeleton
Bug Traps, Spiky Rocks, Stillsand | Home, Checkpoint, Workshop | The Plateau |  |

### The Flesh Pits
The first real stage. Nechepso turns living men to undead, enchanting their bones such that they tear apart the flesh from the inside. The remaining flesh is tossed into the flesh pits. The restless souls of those that meet the gruesome fate have taken root in the flesh of their bodies, crawling the pits as shambling grotesque monsters. Down here, the player faces the Flesh Demon.

Here the Nomad also meets for the first time Geildukhuk.


| Zone | Description | Foes & Hazards | Features | Stages | Connects To |


| The Deluge | Having repaired the Blaster allows one to traverse the Deluge. A place full of wide expanses, great pools of water, flowing waterfalls, and ambient thunder.  |  | Hub — checkpoint, workshop, etc |  | All zones, as it runs centrally down the pillar. |
| The Gardens | Where damage has been done to the deluge, and cracks in the walls have allowed sand to flow in from the storms, life has sprung. Within the gloom of the pillar, rays of light seeping through the walls, vines and trees grow, animals thriving. A curious anomaly. This is the first zone encountered by the player, followed by the deluge. |  |  |  |  |
| The Archives. |  |  |  |  |  |
| The Ancient Forge |  |  |  |  |  |
| The Undead Crypt | Where dead Ancients would be laid to rest. Vacant now, occupied by  |  |  |  |  |
| The conduits. | Run laterally down the length of the pillar, adjacent to the Deluge, like the phloem of a great tree. |  |  |  |  |
| The Zenith | The upper sections of the pillar that follow the Ancient Guardian boss fight. |  |  |  |  |

The Rune Hub

## Stages & Areas
...refer to sub-divisions of a Zone, usually defined as "the area between two checkpoints." Sometimes a checkpoint is a little ways into a stage. A stage can have platforming, combat, or both. Sometimes individual stages require unlockables to be accessed.

Transitory Stages are stages that are not part of the main map that provide a bridge between one area and another. Auxiliary Stages are similar, but act as bonus areas rather than bridges.

A hub refers to a point in the game where the player can rest and receive certain services or meet NPCs. There is never more than one Hub in a zone, and not all Zones have hubs. In some cases, a hub may be the border between a number of Zones. Not all checkpoints are hubs, but all hubs have checkpoints.

| Zone |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desert | The Dune | The first stage consists of the player ascending a large rocky dune. At the top, the player can interact to 'Look' and get a short cutscene that shows the pillar reaching into the sky before him. Then, the player descends freely and reaches the Outer Wall. |
| Deluge |  |  |
| The Zenith | The Outer Wall | The edge of the pillar has been worn away by centuries of storms. High above the surface, the pillar has been worn away enough to expose the inside, featuring grand halls of sheer black stone covered in hills of sand. You must climb from the base of the pillar up the wall until you reach the entrance. |
|  | The Maze | This is one of the safeguards that protects the upper section of the pillar. One must know the correct passage, with any error meaning a number of automatons are alerted, which the player must fight before another attempt can be made.
The player is met with a number of vertical passages in the background, which he can interact to enter. There are four in each room, and three rooms. Making for 256 combinations. The player needs the Spirit Compass item in order to progress through the maze.
Once through the maze, the Ancient Guardians are encountered. One of the last bosses in the game. |
