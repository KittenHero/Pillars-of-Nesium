## Checkpoints
### Primary Checkpoint / "Save Point"
**Appearance**: Fountain
- [ ] *Player can Rest at save point*: At the save point, the player can Rest, which activates the save point. Doing so causes the following to occur:
	- [ ] Replenishes HPP1
	- [ ] Respawns all Enemies
	- [ ] The Nomad respawns at the most recently used checkpoint on Death
	- [ ] Plays the Rest Theme until the player leaves the area
	- [ ] Changes animation

### Secondary Checkpoint / "Checkpoint"
Appearance: None
At certain points, secondary checkpoints are placed. When the player's position needs to be reset, for example after fallinginto a pit hazard, the secondary checkpoint is used.
- [x] Player position reset to checkpoint when taking Reset damage.

## Other Features
### Fishing Spot
The player can go [Fishing](Low%20Priority%20Fishing.md) in any pool of water once he gets the Fishing Rod from the [Merchant](https://www.notion.so/d3170d1efc3a4195bf1a9fefc3b0580e).
Interact near the edge of a Pond to sit down and pull out the rod and start fishing.
The [Fisherman](https://www.notion.so/d3170d1efc3a4195bf1a9fefc3b0580e) can be encountered at any Fishing Spot, but leaves the next time the player uses a checkpoint, or finds a new Fishing Spot.

### Workshop
Lets the player upgrade his gear, or repair broken objects.

### Travel Runes
Left behind by [Rune Makers](Lore.md) of old, when activated these Runes allow one to travel between any other activated rooms bearing the same key. They are placed throughout the pillar, allowing travel between each Zone. Always found near a Fountain.
