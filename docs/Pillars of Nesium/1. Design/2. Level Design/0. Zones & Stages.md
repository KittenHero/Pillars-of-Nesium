# Zones & Stages
## The Map
...is the entire area in which the game takes place. For this game, it will be a small portion of the Nesium Desert.
## Zones
A zone is a thematically distinct area within the map. For the demo, we'll only be creating the flesh pits.
## Stages
Sub-divisions of a Zone, usually defined as "the area between two save points" are called Stages. Save points are almost always in the first Scene of a Zone, though may be a little ways in. In a larger map, this would depend on where the Zone is accessed from. A stage can have platforming, combat, often both.
### Rooms
Rooms are a continuous area of gameplay. They contain a number of obstacles which can include platforming, enemies, hazards, puzzles or boss fights. When travelling between rooms, there is a visual transition as the game opens a new scene.
### Hubs
A hub is a special rest location. There's always a save point, and often NPCs, shops and other activities/services. There is never more than one Hub in a zone, and not all Zones have hubs. In some cases, a hub may be the border or central point between a number of Zones. Not all save points are hubs, but all hubs have save points.
### Transitory & Auxillary Stages
Transitory Stages are stages that are not part of the main map that provide a bridge between one area and another. Auxiliary Stages are similar, but act as bonus areas rather than bridges. There will likely be none of these in the demo, though may be considered once the rest is developed.
