## Collectibles
In the demo, enemies drop a universal currency based on power, like souls in dark souls. We'll call it Essence. While not essential to the demo's gameplay, if we plan to implement similar things in the future it will be worth having a stab at.

## The Shop
In the demo, a shop lets the player spend essence for cosmetics. Most of them are recolours of the player model.
