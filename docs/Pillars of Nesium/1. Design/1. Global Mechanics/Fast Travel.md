### Travel Runes
Left behind by [Rune Makers](Lore.md) of old, when activated these Runes allow one to travel between any other activated rooms bearing the same key. They are placed throughout the pillar, allowing travel between each Zone. Always found near Fountains, but can also be found elsewhere.
