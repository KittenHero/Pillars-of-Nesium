# Magic

Magic is broken up into Boons, Banes and Spells.

Boons are special passive upgrades. Represents assigning the passive energy of your spirit.

Banes are detrimental weaknesses that provide more Boon capacity or other benefits. Represents sacrificing elements of your spirit to access greater reserves of power.

Spells are active magic. Represent draining your spirit’s energy for quick bursts of power.

### Can’t Be Modified

- Mobility — Any changes to mobility may render platforming challenges impossible, or allow the player to access players he shouldn’t

### Banes

Banes are intended to be more punishing than beneficial, and are intended as challenge options for adept players. There is no limit to the number of Banes that can be equipped, though some are incompatible with one another.

Hm, maybe instead of banes adding boon slots they just come with their own benefits? But players may want to play with the downsides only. Worth considering.
