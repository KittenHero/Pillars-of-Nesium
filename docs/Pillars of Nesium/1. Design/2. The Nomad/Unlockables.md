## Weapons
Name | Source | Requirement | Gameplay | Lore | Appearance

**Pistol**
Long range, semi-automatic pistol capable of firing a number of weak shots in quick succession before recharging. Melee deals more damage, so its primary use is to strike distant weak points, foes, and activate out-of-reach triggers.
Can be used to whittle-down enemies from a safe distance, but this takes more time than using melee.
A simple combustion weapon constructed by members of The Nomad’s tribe, using scavenged technology from the ruins of the ancients. Pistols are granted to young tribe members when the adulthood rite of passage is completed.
Constructed of metal and wood, with a pleasant artisanal aesthetic.

**Blaster** Repair Station | Broken Blaster | Short range, single-shot weapon, capable of firing a single, powerful shot before recharging.
The weapon has very high recoil, able to propel the user through the air, or across the ground.
In combat it can propel the user out of (or into) danger, but this trait makes it difficult to rack up damage, making it better as a finisher, or as a hit & run weapon.
Crouching eliminates recoil. | Once wielded by the fallen hero, but lost in a battle with the Last Ancient. The precursor to The Nomad’s adventure. |  |

## Equipment Upgrades

Many combat upgrade paths are available. One may specialise in any of the ranged weapons, or into melee attacks by focusing their funds on certain upgrades. Upgrades can be divided into Combat and Exploration upgrades. Exploration upgrades are essential, and all are required to beat the game, and thus are obtained with a different currency to Combat upgrades, which are not essential.
