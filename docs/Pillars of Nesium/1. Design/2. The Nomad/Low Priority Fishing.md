# Low Priority: Fishing

A mini-game where the player can capture fish to recover HP.

- Fish are collectible and vary by Zone.
- Enemies drop Bait. Bait is required to fish. Using the right kind of bait on the right kind of fish makes it easier to catch.
- Each fish has a distinctly different silhouette & colour scheme.
- The Lantern ability allows the player to hover the cursor over any Pond to reveal the fish within.

## How to Fish

- Sit down at a Pond to pull out your fishing rod.
- Select your bait.
- Observe the water, pick out the silhouette you want to catch.
- Cast the reel as close to that fish as you can.
- Wait for the Bite, not the Nibble. Hooking on a Nibble will lose the fish (and the Bait).
- Hook the Bite. The fish will be hooked, but it's not over yet.
- Reel the line, not too fast, not too slow, or you'll lose the fish. The bigger the fish, the tighter the window.
    - Observe the fish. If it's pulling hard, reel slow. If it's not, reel.
    - Reel too fast, and line strength will go down until it snaps.
    - Reel too slow, and the timer will run out.
- If you've done all that right, then you've caught your fish.

## Fishing Tips

- Identify the type of fish. Machine fish will have straight edges. Regular fish will be smooth.
- Match the bait. Machine fish want machine parts, while regular fish want meat.
    - You can also use Big Bait.
- Wait for the moment, and cast close to the fish you want. All fish will be attracted to your bait, so getting close to the fish you want will ensure you snag it. Waiting until other fish are far from the fish you do want is also a good bet.
