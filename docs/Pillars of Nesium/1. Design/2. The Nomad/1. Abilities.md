# Abilities

# Design Notes
Speed, maneuverability, agility. The character is a desert nomad. Swift, light on his feet, he dodges and deflects, avoiding danger. Thus, none of his moves should make the player feel slow

The Nomad should feel fast and fluid. He should be comfortable and deft in his movements, like the skilled warrior nomad he is.

The Nomad‚Äôs default abilities should also make ‚Äúsense‚Äù, insofar as you can do everything you would expect you can. Running, crawling, jumping, fighting. Different varieties of jumps including long, high and regular. You can crouch, crawl, slide. Each movement should easily chain into the next and able to be ‚Äòcancelled‚Äô, i.e no locking you into long animations.

After a first stage that lets you come to grips with basic movement, you‚Äôll be introduced to the blaster, a powerful weapon that doubles as a traversal tool, enhancing your slides and jumps with powerful bursts of thrust.

The gravity will be low for two reasons: To make the player feel more in control and give them time to react, and because lore-wise this section of the world has low gravity.

Feedback: For the more difficult and precise maneuvers such as blast-sliding, feedback should be given to the Player to show that he has done the move correctly.

# Moves
Grouped by gross category. Checklist to monitor implementation.
### Category
- [x] **Name**: *Controls*
	- Description

## Utility
- [ ] **Look Mode**: *Hold Look-Mode*
	- Normally the camera is fixed, but by holding down the Look Mode button, the camera is freed to an extent. This allows the player to see further than normal, potentially glimpsing hidden areas.
	- Prevents the player from moving whilst active.
- [ ] Switch Weapon
	- As the player's arsenal expands, he'll use different weapons.

## Platforming
### Basic Movement
- [x] **Move left/right**
	- The Nomad runs to the left and right.
- [x] **Jump**
	- Variable jump.
	- Fixed or variable? Need testing. Leaning toward fixed.
- [ ] **High Jump**: *Crouch + Jump*
	- A higher than normal Jump straight upward - minor lateral adjustment.
- [x] **Slide**
	- The character will perform a short but quick slide along the ground, fixed distance. Low-profiles some attacks and projectiles like the crouch. Has i-frames, allowing one to dodge melee attacks and move through enemies. However, i-frames don't count for projectiles.
- [x] **Long Jump**: *Slide + Jump*
	- Jumping during a slide will perform a jump that is longer than normal, but with less height.
- [x] **Crouch**
	- Crouching prevents recoil and low-profiles certain attacks. Important for using blaster on tiny platforms.
- [ ] **Crawl**: *Move + crouch*
	- The crawl will be fast, like an animal running on all fours.
- [x] *No ledge grab. Avoid context sensitivity.*

### Advanced Movement
- [ ] üîí**Wall Grip**: *Jump + Move to wall*
	- You‚Äôll grip onto and slowly slide down a wall.
- [ ] üîí**Wall Jump**: *Whilst using Wall Grip ‚Üí Jump*
	- You‚Äôll launch yourself off the wall
- [ ] üîí**Wall Slide**: *Wall Grip + Slide*
	- You‚Äôll slide directly down the wall. If holding slide, you'll roll along in ball form. See below.
- [ ] üîí**Roll**: *Hold: Slide*
	- Holding the slide key will cause the player to enter a roll. Rolling causes the character to curl into a ball and retain current momentum, but prevents manual acceleration. This is meant to be used in tandem with the weapons and obstacles in the environment. For example, firing the blaster to gain momentum, then rolling to preserve momentum to traverse an area quickly, or roll up a ramp at high speed.
	- Pressing the 'slide' 'crouch' or key will exit the roll. Pressing the 'jump' key will cause the player to jump out of the roll.
	- Consider top speed. Don't want sonic levels.

## Melee
Note: Melee attacks should not restrict movement. Should be able to cancel freel.
Look to **Odin Sphere** for inspiration. The movement & melee is very fluid. The melee attacks changes depending on current movement state. For example - moving, jumping, crouching, sliding, standing still, etc. 

Player has a scimitar. Short range directional (up, across, down) melee with minor recoil & knockback on hit. Player must use this for the first segment of the game, until he unlocks the Blaster.

### Ground Melee
 - [ ] **Up Slash**: Hold up + Melee
 - [ ] **Forward slash**: Moving left/right + Melee
 - [ ] **Standing slash**: Standing + Melee
 - [ ] **Blade sweep**: Crouching + Melee
 - [ ] **Sliding slash**: Sliding + Melee

### Air Melee
- [ ] **Air slash**: Airborne + Melee
- [ ] **Air slash moving left/right**: Airborne + Move left/right + Melee
- [ ] **Air down slash**: Airborne + Move Down + Melee
- [ ] **Air uppercut**: Airborne + Move Up + Melee

### Special Melee
- [ ] üîí**Charge Melee**: Hold: Melee
- [ ] üîí**Deflect**: Deflect

## üîíWind Magic
The guardian spirit empowers the nomad with powerful wind magic that can be used in many ways. It can push the nomad around relative to his surroundings, or push the nomad's surroundings around relative to him. Its effect changes depending on the current state of the character.

### Notes
- [ ] **Wind is directional**: Wind moves character in direction of current movement. If no movement key is pressed, wind moves character in last held direction.
- [ ] Enemies in path of gust get pushed away
- [ ] Character can use Wind indefinitely whilst grounded
- [ ] Character has a Wind Meter which determines how much wind they can use in quick succession.

### Ideas
- Fire magic: same mechanically but with different effects on enemies & surroundings. Can be hot-swapped with wind.

## Control Scheme I
This control scheme uses two unique buttons for all wind-magic abilities. The Wind Move button is used in tandem with existing movement abilities, while the Wind Attack button is used on its own.

### üîíWind Movement
*Unlocked when you gain the Guardian Spirit.*
The 'Wind Move' button is used to propel the character around in various ways & directions. It can also push enemies around, and depending on when it's pressed has different effects/properties (e.g. if close to a wall or the ground, the wind will hit the wall and travel along it). However it always has the effect of pushing the player in the desired direction.

#### Dashes
- [ ] **Dash**: *Wind Move*
- [ ] **Air Dash**: *Airborne: Wind Move*
		- Can dash in 8 directions; Default is forward.
- [ ] **Ground Dash**: *Grounded: Left/Right + Wind Move*
- [ ] üîí**Wall Dash**: *On-Wall: Up/Down + Wind Move*

#### Launch & Burst
There are two unique moves available when Grounded & using Wind Move.
