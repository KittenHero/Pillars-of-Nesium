# Abilities

# Design Notes

Speed, maneuverability, agility. The character is a desert nomad. Swift, light on his feet, he dodges and deflects, avoiding danger. Thus, none of his moves should make the player feel slow

The Nomad should feel fast and fluid. He should be comfortable and deft in his movements, like the skilled warrior nomad he is.

The Nomad’s default abilities should also make “sense”, insofar as you can do everything you would expect you can. Running, crawling, jumping, fighting. Different varieties of jumps including long, high and regular. You can crouch, crawl, slide. Each movement should easily chain into the next and able to be ‘cancelled’, i.e no locking you into long animations.

After a first stage that lets you come to grips with basic movement, you’ll be introduced to the blaster, a powerful weapon that doubles as a traversal tool, enhancing your slides and jumps with powerful bursts of thrust.

The gravity will be low for two reasons: To make the player feel more in control and give them time to react, and because lore-wise this section of the world has low gravity.

Feedback: For the more difficult and precise maneuvers such as blast-sliding, feedback should be given to the Player to show that he has done the move correctly.

# Descriptions

## Utility
### Look Mode
Normally the camera is fixed, but by holding down the Look Mode button, the camera is freed to an extent. This allows the player to see further than normal, potentially glimpsing hidden areas.

Prevents the player from moving whilst active.

## Platforming
### Basic Movement Move Left / Right
The Nomad runs to the left and right.

### Jump
Variable jump.

Fixed or variable? Need testing. Leaning toward fixed.

### Crouch
Crouching prevents recoil and low-profiles certain attacks. Important for using blaster on tiny platforms.

### Crawl
Move + crouch. The crawl will be fast, like an animal running on all fours.

### High Jump
Crouch + Jump
A higher than normal Jump straight upward - minor lateral adjustment.

### Slide
The character will perform a short but quick slide along the ground, fixed distance. Low-profiles some attacks and projectiles like the crouch. Has i-frames, allowing one to dodge melee attacks and move through enemies. However, i-frames don't count for projectiles.

### Long Jump
Slide + Jump
Jumping during a slide will perform a jump that is longer than normal, but with less height.

### 🔒Wall Grip
Jump + Move to wall
You’ll grip onto and slowly slide down a wall.

### 🔒Wall Jump
Whilst using Wall Grip → Jump
You’ll launch yourself off the wall

### 🔒Wall Slide
Wall Grip + Slide
You’ll slide directly down the wall, and roll along if it holding Slide.

### 🔒Roll
Hold: Slide
Holding the slide key will cause the player to enter a roll. Rolling causes the character to curl into a ball and retain current momentum, but prevents manual acceleration. This is meant to be used in tandem with the weapons and obstacles in the environment. For example, firing the blaster to gain momentum, then rolling to preserve momentum to traverse an area quickly, or roll up a ramp at high speed.

Pressing the 'slide' 'crouch' or key will exit the roll. Pressing the 'jump' key will cause the player to jump out of the roll.

Consider top speed. Don't want sonic levels.

### 🔒Air Dash
Jump + Slide
Unlocking the Air Dash also unlocks i-frames for the slide.


Fire the blaster while crouched - negates recoil.

## Melee Combat
Note: Melee attacks should not restrict movement. Should be able to cancel freel.
Look to **Odin Sphere** for inspiration. The movement & melee is very fluid. The melee attacks changes depending on current movement state. For example - moving, jumping, crouching, sliding, standing still, etc. 

Player has a scimitar. Short range directional (up, across, down) melee with minor recoil & knockback on hit. Player must use this for the first segment of the game, until he unlocks the Blaster.

### Ground Melee
 - **Moving left/right + Melee**
 - **Standing + Melee**
 - **Crouching + Melee**
 - **Sliding + Melee**

### Air Melee
- Different variations:
	- **Airborne + Melee** - Air slash
	- **Airborne + Move left/right + Melee** - Air slash moving left/right
	- **Airborne + Move Down + Melee** - Air down slash
	- **Airborne + Move Up + Melee** - Air uppercut.

### 🔒Charge Melee
**Hold: Melee**

### 🔒Deflect
- **Deflect**: Use the scimitar to deflect projectiles, returning them to sender.

## Blaster
### 🔒Standard Shooting
- **Shoot**: Fires a short range blast with a large Area of Effect and high recoil.
- High Damage & Knockback, High Recoil, Short Range, Destroys obstacles
- Recharges while Grounded

### 🔒Stable Shot


### Blaster Movement
### 🔒Blaster Slide
Firing the blaster during a slide will dramatically increase the speed of the slide, and the subsequent roll. A small sound effect and burst of light will indicate when the player has timed

### 🔒Blaster Hop
Firing the blaster at an angle between 91 and 269 degrees will launch the player into the air.

### 🔒Blaster Jump
Firing the blaster midair will propel the player quickly in the opposite direction.
